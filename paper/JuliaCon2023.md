## Title 

MultilayerGraphs.jl: A Julia package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of multilayer graphs

## Session Type 

Lightning talk (10 minutes) 

## Abstract 

**MultilayerGraphs.jl** is a Julia package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of multilayer graphs, which have been adopted to model of a wide range of complex systems from bio-chemical to socio-technical networks.

It is integrated within the **JuliaGraphs** ecosystem extending **Graphs.jl** with several multilayer-specific methods and metrics including the multilayer eigenvector centrality, the multilayer modularity and the Von Newman entropy.
